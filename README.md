This repository builds Python packages which need a compiler for Windows.

Using the [compilers installed in Appveyor](https://www.appveyor.com/docs/installed-software/#python), we can [release binary wheels for Python for Windows](https://github.com/FAForever/lupa-wheel/releases).

The wheels can used by users running the client from source on Windows or the [CI system building client releases](https://github.com/FAForever/client/blob/develop/appveyor.yml).
